# AI Service Improvements

## Identified Issues in AI Tool Flow

### 1. Inconsistent Configuration Management

- **Problem**: Configuration for AI services (OpenRouter, Together.ai, ElevenLabs) was scattered across multiple files with inconsistent naming conventions.
- **Impact**: Difficult to maintain, update, or extend AI service configurations.
- **Example**: Settings were using uppercase naming (`USE_MOCK_AI_SERVICES`) while code was using lowercase (`use_mock_ai_service`).

### 2. Hardcoded Prompts

- **Problem**: Story generation prompts were hardcoded in the `story_generator.py` file as a static method.
- **Impact**: Difficult to modify or experiment with different prompt structures without changing code.
- **Example**: The `build_generation_prompt` method contained a fixed prompt template with no easy way to modify it.

### 3. Duplicated Logic for AI Parameters

- **Problem**: Parameters for AI models (dimensions, steps, temperature, etc.) were duplicated or inconsistently defined.
- **Impact**: Changes to model parameters required updates in multiple places, increasing the risk of inconsistencies.
- **Example**: Image generation parameters were defined both in the `AIService` class and in the calling code.

### 4. Lack of Centralized Prompt Enhancement

- **Problem**: Image prompt enhancement was done directly in the `AIService` class rather than in a dedicated configuration class.
- **Impact**: Difficult to maintain consistent prompt enhancement strategies across different AI services.
- **Example**: Image prompt enhancement logic was mixed with API call logic in the `generate_image` method.

## Implemented Solution: Global AIConfig Class

### 1. Centralized Configuration

- **Solution**: Created a global `AIConfig` class that centralizes all AI-related configurations.
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth for AI configurations, easier to maintain and update.
- **Implementation**: `app/services/ai_config.py` now contains all AI-related configurations.

### 2. Structured Prompt Management

- **Solution**: Implemented Pydantic models for different types of prompts (story, image, audio).
- **Benefits**: Type-safe configuration with default values and clear documentation.
- **Implementation**: `StoryPromptConfig`, `ImagePromptConfig`, and `AudioConfig` classes.

### 3. Consistent Parameter Access

- **Solution**: Added methods to retrieve model parameters for each AI service.
- **Benefits**: Consistent interface for accessing parameters across different AI services.
- **Implementation**: `get_story_generation_params()`, `get_image_generation_params()`, etc.

### 4. Enhanced Prompt Building

- **Solution**: Implemented dedicated methods for building and enhancing prompts.
- **Benefits**: Consistent prompt enhancement strategies that can be easily modified.
- **Implementation**: `build_story_prompt()`, `enhance_image_prompt()` methods.

## Code Changes

### 1. Updated `ai_config.py`

- Added methods for retrieving model parameters for each AI service.
- Structured configuration using Pydantic models.
- Implemented prompt building and enhancement methods.

### 2. Updated `ai_service.py`

- Modified to use the new `AIConfig` class for all AI-related configurations.
- Improved error handling and logging.
- Added a `generate_story` method that uses the new configuration.

### 3. Updated `story_generator.py`

- Removed hardcoded prompt building logic.
- Now uses the `AIConfig` class for prompt building and enhancement.
- Enhanced image prompt generation using the `enhance_image_prompt` method.

### 4. Updated `config.py`

- Standardized naming conventions (lowercase for all settings).
- Added new settings for ElevenLabs configuration.
- Updated API URLs to be more specific.

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Maintainability**: All AI-related configurations are now in one place, making it easier to maintain and update.
2. **Flexibility**: Prompt templates and model parameters can be easily modified without changing code.
3. **Consistency**: Consistent naming conventions and parameter access across all AI services.
4. **Extensibility**: New AI services can be easily added by extending the `AIConfig` class.
5. **Testing**: Easier to mock AI services for testing purposes.

## Future Improvements

1. **Environment-specific configurations**: Add support for different configurations based on the environment (development, testing, production).
2. **Dynamic configuration reloading**: Add support for reloading configurations without restarting the application.
3. **Prompt versioning**: Add support for versioning prompts to track changes and rollback if needed.
4. **A/B testing**: Add support for A/B testing different prompt templates and model parameters.
5. **Monitoring and analytics**: Add support for monitoring prompt performance and collecting analytics.
