# Scene Fields Analysis

## Overview

This document provides an in-depth analysis of how the `text`, `title`, `description`, and `image_prompt` fields related to Scene entities are used across the StoryMimi backend application. The analysis covers their usage in data models, validation, API endpoints, database operations, and AI service integration.

## Data Model Definition

### Scene Model

In `story_types.py`, the Scene model is defined as a Pydantic model with the following fields:

- **text**: Required field with string validation (min_length=10, max_length=1000)
  - Description: "The text content of the scene"
  - Primary content field that holds the narrative text for each scene

- **title**: Optional field with string validation (min_length=3, max_length=100)
  - Description: "The title of the scene"
  - Used for organizational purposes and UI display

- **description**: Optional field with string validation (min_length=10, max_length=500)
  - Description: "A brief description of the scene"
  - Used for summarization and metadata purposes

- **image_prompt**: Optional field with string validation (min_length=10, max_length=1000)
  - Description: "The prompt used to generate the scene image"
  - Used specifically for AI image generation

## Field Usage Across the Application

### 1. API Layer (`app/api/stories.py`)

The API layer primarily handles Scene objects as part of the StoryDetail response model:

- In the `get_story` endpoint, Scene objects are returned as part of the StoryDetail response
- The API layer doesn't directly manipulate individual Scene fields but passes complete Scene objects
- Validation of Scene fields happens through the Validator class before responses are returned

### 2. Service Layer (`app/services/story_service.py`)

The service layer handles Scene objects in several ways:

- In `get_story_detail`, Scene objects are constructed from database records
- Scene fields are not individually manipulated at this layer
- The service layer acts as a coordinator between the API and database layers

### 3. Database Layer (`app/database/supabase_client/`)

#### Scene Repository (`scenes_db_client.py`)

- **text**: Stored directly in the database as a required field
  - Used in `create_scene` method as a required parameter
  - Retrieved in `get_scene` and `get_story_scenes` methods

- **title** and **description**: Not directly stored in the database schema
  - These fields are not parameters in the `create_scene` method
  - This suggests these fields might be generated or populated at runtime rather than stored persistently

- **image_prompt**: Not directly stored in the database schema
  - Not a parameter in the `create_scene` method
  - Used transiently for image generation but not persisted

#### Story Repository (`stories_db_client.py`)

- Handles Story objects but doesn't directly interact with Scene fields
- Provides methods to retrieve scenes associated with a story

### 4. AI Service Integration (`app/services/ai_service.py`)

- **text**: Used directly in the `generate_audio` method
  - The text field content is sent to the ElevenLabs API to generate audio
  - This creates a direct link between the scene's narrative text and its audio representation

- **image_prompt**: Used in the `generate_image` method
  - The image_prompt field is sent to the Together.ai API to generate scene images
  - This creates a direct link between the scene's image prompt and its visual representation

### 5. Story Generation (`app/services/story_generator.py`)

The story generation process handles Scene fields in specific ways:

- **text**: Generated by the AI service and used as the primary content field
  - Used to generate audio through the AI service
  - Stored in the database as the main scene content

- **title**: Generated with placeholder values ("Scene {index+1}")
  - Not stored in the database but generated at runtime

- **description**: Generated with placeholder values ("Description for scene {index+1}")
  - Not stored in the database but generated at runtime

- **image_prompt**: Generated by the AI service
  - Used to generate images through the AI service
  - Not stored in the database but used transiently

### 6. Validation (`app/utils/validator.py`)

The Validator class handles Scene fields in specific ways:

- **text**: Validated as a required field with type checking
  - Checked in the `validate_scene` method
  - Must be present and of string type

- **title**, **description**, **image_prompt**: Not explicitly validated
  - These fields are optional in the Scene model
  - No specific validation logic for these fields in the Validator class

### 7. JSON Conversion (`app/utils/json_converter.py`)

The JSONConverter class handles Scene fields during serialization/deserialization:

- **text**: Extracted and included in both directions (to/from JSON)
  - Required field in both directions

- **image_prompt**: Extracted and included in both directions when available
  - Optional field that's preserved during conversion

- **title** and **description**: Not explicitly handled in the conversion methods
  - This suggests they might be generated or populated at runtime

## Field Flow Through the Application

### Request Flow

1. A StoryRequest is received through the API with a title and prompt
2. The story generation process is initiated asynchronously
3. The AI service generates Scene objects with text and image_prompt fields
4. The image_prompt is used to generate images via the AI service
5. The text is used to generate audio via the AI service
6. The Scene objects are stored in the database with text, image_url, and audio_url
7. Title and description are generated as placeholders during response preparation

### Response Flow

1. When a story is requested, the database records are retrieved
2. Scene objects are constructed from the database records
3. Title and description fields are populated with placeholder values
4. The complete StoryDetail with Scene objects is returned through the API

## Key Findings

1. **Storage vs. Runtime Fields**:
   - **text**: Persistently stored in the database and used throughout the application
   - **image_prompt**: Used transiently for image generation but not stored persistently
   - **title** and **description**: Generated at runtime with placeholder values, not stored persistently

2. **Field Importance**:
   - **text**: Primary content field, required throughout the application
   - **image_prompt**: Critical for image generation but ephemeral
   - **title** and **description**: Secondary metadata fields, used primarily for UI display

3. **Validation Priorities**:
   - **text**: Strictly validated as required with length constraints
   - **image_prompt**, **title**, **description**: Less strictly validated as optional fields

4. **AI Service Integration**:
   - **text**: Directly used for audio generation
   - **image_prompt**: Directly used for image generation
   - **title** and **description**: Not used in AI service integration

## Recommendations

1. **Persistence Consistency**: Consider storing image_prompt, title, and description persistently in the database for better data integrity and to avoid regenerating them

2. **Validation Enhancement**: Implement more comprehensive validation for all Scene fields, including optional ones

3. **Field Generation**: Improve the generation of title and description fields beyond placeholder values to enhance the user experience

4. **Documentation**: Add more detailed documentation about the lifecycle and usage of each Scene field throughout the application

5. **Field Standardization**: Standardize the handling of Scene fields across all application layers for better consistency and maintainability
